Implement a program that uses a synchronized block to update a shared counter variable across multiple threads.
Imagine a scenario where a bank needs to keep track of the total balance in its accounts (i.e. the balance of bank).
Multiple threads are involved in the transactions, such as deposits and withdrawals, and the balance needs to be updated in real-time.
