Implement a program that uses a countdown latch to wait for all threads to finish executing before
proceeding to the next step.

In a multi-threaded program, it is common to have multiple threads running in parallel
 and performing different tasks concurrently. However, sometimes it may be necessary
 to wait for all the threads to finish executing before proceeding with the next step of the program.
  This can be achieved using a CountDownLatch.

A CountDownLatch is a synchronization primitive that allows one or more threads to wait
 until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes. It works by initializing the
 latch with a count, and each thread that needs to wait on the latch decrements the count when it completes its work.
When the count reaches zero, the waiting threads are released and can continue their work.
